# Homepage Information Architecture Improvements

## Current Issues

1. **"Resources" is too generic** - mixes reading, speaking, vocabulary, and study tools
2. **No clear learning path** - beginners don't know where to start
3. **Inconsistent card sizing** - Arabic Alphabet card is smaller
4. **No skill-based grouping** - activities aren't organized by learning skill
5. **Study tools mixed with practice** - Vocabulary Review is a tool, not a practice activity
6. **Dialect Practice unclear** - doesn't explain what's inside each dialect section

## Proposed Structure

### Option 1: Skill-Based Organization (Recommended)

```
1. Getting Started (for beginners)
   - Arabic Alphabet (prominent, larger card)
   - Choose Your Dialect (quick guide)

2. Practice Activities
   - Reading Practice
     • Stories
     • Videos
   - Speaking Practice
     • Speak
     • Tutor
   - Sentence Practice
     • Sentences

3. Study Tools
   - Vocabulary Review (spaced repetition)
   - [Future: Grammar Practice, etc.]

4. Dialect-Specific Learning
   - Egyptian Arabic
   - Modern Standard Arabic (Fusha)
   - Moroccan Arabic (Darija)
```

### Option 2: User Journey-Based

```
1. New to Arabic?
   - Start Here: Arabic Alphabet
   - Choose Your Dialect

2. Practice Your Skills
   - Reading: Stories, Videos
   - Speaking: Speak, Tutor
   - Writing: [Link to dialect pages]
   - Vocabulary: [Link to dialect pages]

3. Review & Study
   - Vocabulary Review (spaced repetition)

4. Explore Dialects
   - Egyptian Arabic
   - Modern Standard Arabic
   - Moroccan Arabic
```

### Option 3: Activity Type + Dialect Hybrid

```
1. Core Learning
   - Arabic Alphabet (beginner)
   - Vocabulary Review (all levels)

2. Practice Activities
   - Reading: Stories, Videos
   - Speaking: Speak, Tutor, Sentences

3. Dialect-Specific Content
   - Egyptian Arabic (Vocabulary, Writing, Grammar)
   - Modern Standard Arabic (Vocabulary, Writing)
   - Moroccan Arabic (Vocabulary, Writing)
```

## Recommended Implementation: Option 1 (Skill-Based)

### Benefits:
- Clear learning path for beginners
- Logical grouping by skill type
- Separates practice from study tools
- Makes it easy to find activities by what you want to practice
- Scalable - easy to add new activities

### Visual Hierarchy:
1. **Getting Started** (larger, more prominent)
2. **Practice Activities** (grouped by skill)
3. **Study Tools** (separate section)
4. **Dialect Learning** (comprehensive resources)

## Additional Improvements

1. **Add visual icons** to each card for quick recognition
2. **Add skill level indicators** (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
3. **Add "New" or "Popular" badges** to highlight features
4. **Consider a "Quick Actions" section** for logged-in users
5. **Add search functionality** for power users
6. **Make Arabic Alphabet more prominent** - larger card or hero section
7. **Add a "Recommended for You"** section based on user progress
